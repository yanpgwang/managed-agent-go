# Design provenance

Mango records material external influences so its independent design remains
auditable. Public specifications and SDKs may be deliberately reused or adapted
for terminology, routes, resource shapes, JSON fields, event types, public
client types, workflows, and edge cases. Mango does not rename a sound concept
merely to appear different. Once adopted, the resulting surface is Mango-owned;
the source does not define its target contract or create compatibility,
synchronization, or release-timing obligations. Mango's documentation, OpenAPI
definition, implementation, and tests are authoritative for current behavior.

Mango's implementation, storage, scheduling, and runtime design are independent
and self-hosted. Public surface definitions may be design inputs, but external
implementation code and non-public types must not be copied, and an external
release is never an automatic roadmap.

## File-backed Session messages

- The [Managed Agents event API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/sessions/events)
  defines `user.message` document sources that reference a previously uploaded
  File by `file_id`.
- The [Files API guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)
  defines upload-once File resources, non-downloadable client uploads, and
  File references in message requests.
- `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` at the version pinned in `go.mod`
  supplied request and response examples during early development. It is not a
  runtime dependency, compatibility baseline, or authority over Mango's API.

Mango's bounded UTF-8 projection, private admission snapshot, S3-compatible
storage, and explicit rejection of multimodal File sources are local design
choices documented in [Files](api/files.md) and
[capabilities and limits](capabilities.md).

## File-backed Session Resources

- The [Managed Agents Files guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/files)
  defines independently copied File resources, their read-only presentation
  beneath `/mnt/session/uploads`, optional mount paths, and runtime add/delete.
- `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` at the version pinned in `go.mod`
  supplied Session Resource request and response examples during early
  development. Existing tests using those types may change or be removed with
  Mango's `/v1` design.
- OpenSandbox and Daytona behavior is implemented against their pinned official
  Go clients. The [OpenSandbox Go SDK](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox/blob/main/sdks/sandbox/go/README.md)
  and [Daytona filesystem guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/file-system-operations/)
  define streaming upload/download, metadata and permission operations,
  directory management, and move/delete; these provider APIs are implementation
  dependencies rather than definitions of Mango's target contract.

Mango's provider-owned marker format and retry algorithm are independent local
design choices documented in [Sandbox backends](sandboxes.md). OpenSandbox and
Daytona intentionally stop at writable sandbox-local copies in the current
implementation; this limitation is documented as Mango behavior rather than
inferred from provider APIs.
